Well, I was hoping for a chat bot on how to deal with anxiety and depression

### Chatbot:

I see. It can be overwhelming at times when you have anxiety or depression. I am here to help guide you through some coping mechanisms that could help you along the way. Have you ever thought about trying yoga or meditation? This may help lower your stress levels and help balance out your moods. Yoga and meditation can be done by anyone, anytime anywhere. For example, there are plenty of YouTube videos on the subject to help teach others these helpful techniques.

### Human:

I'm a little nervous.

### Chatbot:

Sometimes it may feel easier or more comfortable for you to talk to someone who is not as close to your life about how you are feeling. This way, they can help guide you through some ways that could potentially make you feel better. If you still are not sure on what you want to do I suggest talking to a therapist. He/she will be able to provide their professional and personal insight into any questions or concerns you may have about your mental health.

### Human:

I'm just so sad, Jane. Why does everyone think I am a loser?

### Chatbot:

It is common for us to go through different stages of life that affect our mood and can make us feel discouraged at times. It’s normal to lose focus on your goals sometimes as you are getting older, so don’t worry about it! If people were making fun of you or saying things to make you upset or uncomfortable, remember that those aren't the kind of people who are worth your time anyway. They aren't very nice and probably should not be in your life.

### Human:

They do?
