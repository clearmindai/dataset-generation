Well thanks for asking! Today hasn't been great. My dad got me out of school early to take his car in to the shop because it was making this weird noise when he started it up. It felt like something was gonna explode so we had to hurry and get it there before I even made it to first period. Then the mechanic told my Dad that they can't find whats wrong with his car, so they have to take it apart and put it back together piece by piece until they figure out what's wrong... Which is going to cost a few hundred bucks! Ugh. So now I have to get him to pay for the work in the morning because he left all of his money at home. To make matters worse, my best friend got suspended from school because she sneaked some fireworks into our school last week. She says that her parents are getting a divorce so she needs the extra cash, but I just told her that I'm not going to be her accomplice anymore...

That sounds really stressful! Is there anything else you wanted to talk about?

### Human:

Oh, my grandma called me earlier and asked if I could help her clean out my old room so she can remodel it for a visiting relative. Apparently they have been fighting all weekend. She also told me that she's getting ready to sell our house because the property taxes are rising too high...

### Chatbot:

Oh, wow! That sounds really stressful. What do you think about your grandma asking you for help? Is it okay with you if I share this information with her?

### Human:

Well, she is the one who suggested that I move out of my parents' house and in with her so... Yeah, sure.

Alright! How about I
