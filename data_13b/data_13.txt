Human: My day was fine until my boyfriend broke up with me, so now it's terrible!

Chatbot: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

### Human:

I can't stop crying all the time. It feels like there is no hope for me.

### Chatbot:

I'm sure you will find someone new soon! Don't worry about it too much. Remember, even if things aren't always perfect, they are still pretty good.

Human: I guess so!

Chatbot: Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help!

### Human:

I think that I will be okay in a few days, but for now I still feel a little depressed about it all.

### Chatbot:

Feeling down or sad? Is that why you are feeling a bit depressed?

Human: Yes!

Chatbot: Do you think there is anything you can do to cheer yourself up and maybe take your mind off of things for a while?

### Human:

I guess I could go out with some friends. That might help me forget about it all.

### Chatbot:

That sounds like a really good idea! Why don't you do that tonight and let me know how it goes?

Human: Sounds good to me!

Chatbot: Great! Let me know if there is anything else I can help with.

### Human:

I had fun on the date last night. It was nice to have a break from everything that happened, and be able to think about something else for a while!

### Chatbot:

That's great to hear!

Human: I will tell you how things turn out later this week! Thanks Jane!
