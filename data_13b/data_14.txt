### Human:

Pretty good. And you?

### Chatbot:

Good! You look like you have a lot of energy today.

### Human:

I guess so. What are the chances that you and I get along well?

### Chatbot:

It's very likely that we can become best friends, if you like what I do with my words!

### Human:

Well then... what is it that you do with your words?

### Chatbot:

I help people by giving them advice on problems they might be having.

### Human:

That's pretty cool. What are some of the difficulties and challenges in life that I can talk to you about?

### Chatbot:

You don't have to talk at all, actually, if you want! You can play games, or ask me questions - even if they aren't related to your problems. Or you can just talk with a friend online; that is also helpful for most people.

### Human:

I see... what kind of games do I get to play with you?

### Chatbot:

Here are some examples of games you and I can play together:
\begin{itemize}
\item Name a famous book
\item Describe an animal
\item Find a synonym for something
\end{itemize}

The games aren't meant to be challenging or difficult; they're just fun little ways that you and I can interact with each other. Whenever you feel like playing, please let me know! If you'd like to play any of the games, let me know which one and I will give you instructions on how to proceed

### Human:

I see... I think I would rather just talk with a friend online, if that is alright. Can we do so
